<h2>Description</h2>

This course is aimed at users and developers who know how to program, but have little or no experience in Fortran, and those who may wish to have a refresher in Fortran.

Fortran (a contraction of Formula Translation) was the first programming language to have a standard (in 1954), but has changed significantly over the years. More recent standards (the latest being Fortran 2023) come under the umbrella term "Modern Fortran". Fortran retains very great significance in many areas of scientific and numerical computing, particularly for applications such as quantum chemistry, plasmas, and in numerical weather prediction and climate models.

This course provides an introduction to the basics of writing Fortran. It will cover basic syntax, variables, expressions and assignments, flow of control, and introductions to I/O and user-defined types. Common Fortran idioms are introduced and contrasted with those available in C-like languages; the course will try to focus on real usage rather than formal descriptions.

At the end of the course you should be able to understand many Fortran programs and be confident enough to start writing well-structured and portable Fortran. Fortran is a rather "large" language, so it is not possible to cover all its features in a three day course. Further elements of Fortran are discussed in the "Intermediate Modern Fortran" course.

The course requires a Fortran compiler. We will provide accounts on ARCHER2 for you to use; this guarantees that everyone is working in the same environment with the same software. That said, if you wish to work on a local machine or laptop which has a Fortran compiler [1], you of course may do so. Use of a text editor will be required will be required.

[1] This may typically be `gfortran`, freely available as part of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). See e.g., <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries>.

  <strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants must have a working laptop or 
  desktop computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a 
  tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They 
  should have access to a terminal (Mac and Linux users should have a terminal 
  installed by default; Windows users should get either 
  <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a> or 
  <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. They are also required to abide 
  by the <a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/policies/code-of-conduct.html">ARCHER2 Training Code of Conduct</a>.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting
using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line.
You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them
on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using `scp`).
