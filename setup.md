Please try to complete the following setup tasks ahead of the lesson. 

## Create appropriate SAFE and ARCHER2 machine accounts

Course attendees should have received instructions on how to set up an ARCHER2 [SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) account.
Details are available in the [ARCHER2 documentation][archer2-quickstart].

You will firstly create a SAFE account. The [SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) is used to manage ARCHER2 projects and accounts. Once you have a SAFE account, you will then be able to request an account on ARCHER2 itself. (If you already have a SAFE or ARCHER2 machine account, you may reuse those.)

Any problems encountered will be addressed as the first part of the course.
